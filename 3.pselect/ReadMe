Steps to Execute the Program
----------------------------
1.Execute the mkpipe file to create two named pipes pone and ptwo.
2.Execute the pselect file to let program wait on read() for both pipes.
3.Execute the wrPipe1 from another terminal and see that its received in the
  pselect and the read() call returns.
4.Execute the wrPipe2 from another terminal and see that its received in the
  pselect and the read() call returns.
5.Now we want to generate a signal from another terminal and see if pselect 
  is unblocked by it.
  Open another terminal and run $ps -ax to find PID of pselect program.
    Run $kill -2 <PID>       -->SIGINT
    Run $kill -3 <PID>       -->SIGQUIT
  To skip the hassle with finding PID and again typing it just use the
  following variant:
    Run $pkill -2 pselect    -->SIGINT
    Run $pkill -3 pselect    -->SIGQUIT
  In the pselect it goes to signal handler if signal is received successfully.
  You can define any custom action based on that.
