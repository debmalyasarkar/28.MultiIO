Steps to Execute the Program
----------------------------
1.Execute the mkpipe file to create two named pipes pone and ptwo.
2.Execute the multiIOProblem file to let program wait on read() for both pipes.
3.Execute the wrPipe1 from another terminal and see that its received in the
  multiIOProblem and the read() call returns.
  Now it blocks on the second read.
4.Execute the wrPipe2 from another terminal and see that its received in the
  multiIOProblem and the read() call returns.
5.Now execute the multiIOProblem again.
6.Execute wrPipe2 from another terminal, observe that the write is succesful but
  the data is not received as the multiIOProblem is waiting on the first read().
  This is a major problem which we want to overcome to achieve concurrency while
  handling multiple IO streams.
  A non-blocking mode is more suitable for most applications.
