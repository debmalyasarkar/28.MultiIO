Steps to Execute the Program
----------------------------
1.Execute the mkpipe file to create two named pipes pone and ptwo.
2.Execute the select program file to let program wait on read() for both pipes.
3.Execute the wrPipe1 from another terminal and see that its received in the
  select program and the read() call returns.
4.Execute the select program file to let program wait on read() for both pipes.
5.Execute the wrPipe2 from another terminal and see that its received in the
  select program and the read() call returns.
6.We see that here one read does not block for other.
  Whichever comes is processed immediately.
7.Now execute the select again but do not run any other write program.
8.The select call returns automatically after the programmed timeout period.

The select2 program runs in a while loop. It re initializes select system call 
after every iteration so it is suitable for superloop based applications.
