----------------------------
1.Execute the mkpipe file to create two named pipes pone and ptwo.
2.Execute the poll program file to let program wait on read() for both pipes.
3.Execute the wrPipe1 from another terminal and see that its received in the
  poll program and the read() call returns.
4.Execute the poll program file to let program wait on read() for both pipes.
5.Execute the wrPipe2 from another terminal and see that its received in the
  poll program and the read() call returns.
6.We see that here one read does not block for other.
  Whichever comes is processed immediately.
7.Now execute the poll again but do not run any other write program.
8.The poll call returns automatically after the programmed timeout period.
